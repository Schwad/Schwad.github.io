## Hello There

My name is Nick Schwaderer and I currently live in beautiful Cornwall
in the UK.

I grew up in equally beautiful Superior, Montana in the United States, where
I worked as a local journalist, sawmill employee, and two-term State Legislator
before moving to the UK to work full time as a Ruby on Rails engineer at OceansHQ.

My day job involves solving problems for various government clients around the
globe, building exciting new features for Maritime Administrations and maintaining
a large flagship SaaS product. [Check us out at OceansHQ](www.oceanshq.com)

On my own time I enjoy unique challenges and work, so if you would like to hire
me, feel free to [get in touch.](mailto:nicholas.schwaderer@gmail.com)

## OceansHQ

I was brought on to OceansHQ in early 2016 as a full-time Ruby on Rails lead
developer in house in Cornwall, England. Our client list is growing by the quarter
and includes around half a dozen national governments, including the United Kingdom.

I spend most of my time working on the VesselHQ system, which allows Maritime Registries
to do their work in the 21st Century with a self-hosted, top-of-the-line SaaS framework.

This work includes:

  -Implementing feature requests and enhancements requested by our clients or in house using TDD principles

  -Refactoring and profiling segments of code to improve performance and reliability

  -Building out a suite of over 2,000 tests from scratch

  -Bulk data migration during onboarding (from spreadsheets to databases to everything in between)

  -Code reviewing pull requests from other developers at OceansHQ
