Say you have elements 1-50 that you lazy load onto a page.

Say that, to improve UI/UX, you lazy load them.

However, in Capybara, if there's a break on a feature test, it never loads. Crap!

So you go along with thoughtbot's wait_for_ajax

And to be double sure, you include a wait_for_element where you wait for your spinners
to go away.

However, you overhaul your code and now everything's broken, and all you have is this
timeout error. You know things are broken but not WHY, you just have the binary response
about whether lazy loading is dispensed. DARN!

you need verbose breaking.
