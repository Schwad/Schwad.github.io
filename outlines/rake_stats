- have talked about this feature in blog posts since 2007, a decade old! http://www.pervasivecode.com/blog/2007/06/28/hacking-rakestats-to-get-gross-loc/

- breaking down code statistics calculator: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/111736ddf6fe81f3e42af37dfa1b0520a8c91473/railties/lib/rails/code_statistics_calculator.rb

- larger code statistics file: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/111736ddf6fe81f3e42af37dfa1b0520a8c91473/railties/lib/rails/code_statistics.rb

- called from here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/111736ddf6fe81f3e42af37dfa1b0520a8c91473/railties/lib/rails/tasks/statistics.rake

- direct link to tweet that started it all: https://twitter.com/dhh/status/891703224964702210

- maybe continue this discussion to see if it could lead to my first rails contribution to tweak this file!...
