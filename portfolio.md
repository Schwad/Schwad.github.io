Hello there. My name is Nick Schwaderer and I currently live in beautiful Cornwall
in the UK.

I grew up in equally beautiful Superior, Montana in the United States, where
I worked as a local journalist, sawmill employee, and two-term State Legislator
before moving to the UK to work full time as a Ruby on Rails engineer at OceansHQ.

My day job involves solving problems for various government clients around the
globe, building exciting new features for Maritime Administrations and maintaining
a large flagship SaaS product.

On my own time I enjoy unique challenges and work, so if you would like to hire
me, feel free to [get in touch.](mailto:nicholas.schwaderer@gmail.com)
