Hello there. My name is Nick Schwaderer and I currently live in beautiful Cornwall
in the UK.

My day job at OceansHQ involves solving problems for various government clients around the
globe, building exciting new features for Maritime Administrations and maintaining
a large flagship SaaS product.

On my own time I enjoy unique challenges and work, so if you would like to hire
me, feel free to [get in touch.](mailto:nicholas.schwaderer@gmail.com)
