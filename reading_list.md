## Tech/Work Related

 * [React Native Helpful Resources](https://github.com/Schwad/reactnative-sandbox/blob/master/helpful_resources.md)
   - As I slowly dab my toes further into React Native, I'll be curating a list of what I've found to be helpful resources on it here. They are collated from a few places that already exist, and will be sprinkled with [field stones](http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/weinberg_on_writing.html) I've found along the way.

 * [Refactoring.com](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)
   - This resource has an endless supply of tools for your toolbox when it comes to refactoring. Don't leave home without it. 

 * [Implementing Classification Using A SVM In Ruby](http://www.practicalai.io/implementing-classification-using-a-svm-in-ruby/)
   - I'm always hearing about machine learning (don't all devs), and all those fancy hip topics. I managed to safely avoid it until I stumbled upon this article and [accompanying repo](https://github.com/daugaard/example-svm) showing a fun, simple use case using an SVM for Machine Learning in Ruby. Loved it.

 * [Sitepoint: Introduction to Using Redis with Rails](https://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-to-using-redis-with-rails/)
   - The example didn't necessarily speak to me as I already use the [friendly_id](https://github.com/norman/friendly_id) gem to cover off this use case. However,
   it did open up my eyes to the power of redis and lead to my using it to solve a
   few problems with existing production applications.
 * [Thoughtbot: How to Skim a Pull Request - Mike Burns](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-smelly-list)
   - When you work remote or as part of a small team as a rails engineer, it's important to challenge
   yourself and your code habits. I found this piece a useful resource on what other teams see as
   'red flags'.

 * [RailsConf 2016 - Making a Rails App with 140 Characters (or less) by Nate Berkopec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXV-RRsjsFc&index=4&list=PLE7tQUdRKcyZGYLfj6oRQWPxB6ijg1YsC)
   - It's amazing how much you can work in a framework without questioning massive regions of the codebase you see every day. Berkopec takes YAGNI to the extreme to show the minimal amount of code you need to have a legitimate, running Rails application. The benefit of watching this isn't really to try and play code golf, but give even seasoned devs a good crash course on the whole default Rails directory and what its purpose is.


## Fiction

  * [The Naulahka - Rudyard Kipling/Wolcott Balestier](https://www.amazon.com/Naulakha-Rudyard-Kipling-ebook/dp/B01FM46RE6/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491813136&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=the+naulhaka)
    - I picked up an 1800s version of this in a used bookshop in Plymouth for eight pounds. It was in fantastic condition. I enjoyed a swashbuckling story about a 20-something state legislator named Nick from Colorado sailing to India to chase some famed jewels and a woman he loved.
  * [The Foundation Trilogy - Isaac Asimov](https://www.amazon.com/Foundation-Trilogy-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0307292061/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1491813281&sr=8-1&keywords=the+foundation+trilogy)
    - My father lobbied me from a young age to read this trilogy. During my time at Plymouth University and after, I started and stopped. I've recently picked it up again and hope to have it concluded soon. Fantastic old school sci fi trilogy that I would heartily recommend to anyone. The way the Aasimov constructs a Universe with logic and his own invented "psycho-history" at the core is fascinating. Great reading.
