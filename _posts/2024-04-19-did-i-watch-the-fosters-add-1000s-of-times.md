In my post ["You are what you see"](https://schwad.github.io/2024/04/18/you-are-what-you-see.html) I talk about the Foster's ad that I'd seen, what seemed like, endlessly during my youth. Which prompted a little niggling curiosity in my mind. Did I actually watch this ad _thousands_ of times?

Let's explore.

We didn't have smartphones. In my free time I did do a fair few enriching activities (raising poultry, archery, hiking, swimming, fishing) and some unenriching activites (Playstation, Gameboy, chatrooms). But where I grew up *television was king*.

Thursday nights? ER. Sunday nights? X-Files. Weekend afternoon? Family blockbuster movie. We didn't go on "holidays" like many in Europe do, and we didn't camp like many where I lived did. The TV was the down time and our chance to connect with the world.

<hr>

This source alleges the mean number of hours of TV watched in America is around [4 hours a day](https://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&health.html#tv_stats). This [slightly-better-looking](https://www.statista.com/statistics/411775/average-daily-time-watching-tv-us-by-age/) data indicates the number is actually less for non-retirees, and is decreasing year on year for the younger folks.

Let's just say I averaged 4.5 hours of TV per day. Though I know some days would've been MUCH more. This *very* helpful [overview of the campaign](https://www.encyclopedia.com/marketing/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fosters-group-limited) indicates it ran from 1994 to 2001. Allegedly it won awards. The budget was initially $3 million a year and then $10 million a year. It seems I wouldn't have seen it before 1997 on the lower budget.The *conclusion* of the ad campaign is unclear, but it appears reasonable to assume it wrapped up around 2004.

Seven years? Cool. That should be enough information to start making some inferences.

**Seven** years times **365** days times **4.5** hours is **11,497.5** hours of television-watching. That's 14-28 ads per hour based [on estimates](https://mocktheagency.com/content/how-many-tv-ads-per-hour/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20viewers%20watch%20around,ad%20is%2030%20seconds%20long.). This changes based on the length of the ad - some are 5 second bumpers and others are 60 seconds long.

I would've watched HBO and films too. Let's say that was a quarter of my watching (generous - probably less). And also considering time where there would *never* be a Foster's commercial (Saturday morning cartoons). I think 10 qualified ads per hour of TV watched is a reasonable estimate.

Which makes us at a cool 114,975 ads. Let's make it 115,000 because we can.

That's..... Not a lot? The upper bound (if I watched more TV and underestimated ad density) is probably around 200,000 and the lower bound I would be shocked if it's under 100,000. The smell test estimates 45 ads a day and I tell you what I'm pretty sure I _far_ exceeded that number some afternoons watching MTV.

So what we need is 1 in a 100, or 1 in 50 if we want to say "thousands" of times. That's our final question.

(That or debunk one of my estimates above to vastly increase the gross number of ads watched.)

This [2001 NYT Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/06/business/media-business-advertising-foster-s-beer-putting-new-twist-its-longtime-speak.html#:~:text=The%20new%20TV%20spots%20run%20for%2030%20seconds%20%2D%2D%20twice%20the%20length%20of%20previous%20commercials%20%2D%2D%20and%20are%20being%20shown%20on%20cable%20channels%20like%20ESPN%2C%20Comedy%20Central%20and%20VH1.) hints that the ads were played heavily on Comedy Central, VH1, ESPN and also _radio_.

And if you remember how these ads come along, it's not an even distribution. An afternoon of Comedy Central or Sportscenter and you might see this ad *every ad break*. So perhaps 12 times in a day. This would be nearly 4,000 times a *year* at that pace!

I watched ESPN, Comedy Central and VH1 a lot as a teen. And if you wrap in radio (~5-8 hrs a week?) - I declare this to be **plausible**. I've even been conservative enough that the true figure could be much, much higher!

I've watched the Foster's ad thousands of times. Maybe you have too.
