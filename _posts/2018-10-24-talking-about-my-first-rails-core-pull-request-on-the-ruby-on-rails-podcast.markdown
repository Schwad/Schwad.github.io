I have been listening to a slew of Ruby and Rails podcasts for years [(you can see some of my favorites here)](https://schwad.github.io/favorite_resources/).

One that I absolutely love is [The Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails) hosted by [Brittany Martin](https://twitter.com/BrittJMartin). At the time of writing it's closing in on its 250th episode and will be [_celebrating its 10th anniversary in a few months_](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/page/25). Wow.

Needless to say I was absolutely honored when I was invited to speak and share my story a few weeks ago; from dipping my toes into very small bits of open source to getting a meaningful Rails PR accepted by DHH himself. [Check it out! And subscribe if you haven't!](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/245)
