[![Ruby Talk](https://i.imgur.com/32Q56dM.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtBckwQaEBA)

I was recently invited to [Sheffield Ruby User Group](https://shrug.org/meetings/shrug-103/) to share the story of MaraBot, [a very personal project](https://github.com/schwad/mara) to help use machine learning and weather shifts to regain control over managing chronic pain.

Around the time of giving this talk I had started the full-application-rewrite. This revisit shifts focus to multiple open users and using Telegram instead of Twilio for interactions (and to enable location sharing). It will also automate nightly 'forecast tests' to improve over the 'manual accuracy tests' I had been running myself before.

I am happy to report the rewrite has entered alpha-testing and will hopefully be green-lit for beta-testing in the next few weeks. I am very much looking forward to writing a more in depth article (and speaking) on the results of further iterations.
