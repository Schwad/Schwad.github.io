### Sidequest: Did I see these ads *thousands* of times?

In my post "We Are What We See" I talk about the Foster's ad that I'd seen, what seemed like, endlessly during my youth. Which prompted a little niggling curiosity in my mind. Did I actually watch this ad _thousands_ of times?

Let's explore.

We didn't have smartphones. In my free time I did do a fair few enriching activities (raising poultry, archery, hiking, swimming, fishing) and a fair few unenriching activites (Playstation, Gameboy, chatrooms). But where I grew up *television was king*.

Thursday nights? ER. Sunday nights? X-Files. Weekend afternoon? Family blockbuster movie. We didn't go on "holidays" like many in Europe do, and we didn't camp like many where I lived did. The TV was the down time and our chance to connect with the world.

* This possibly-not-credible-source said the mean number of hours of TV watched in America is around [4 hours a day](https://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&health.html#tv_stats). This [slightly better looking](https://www.statista.com/statistics/411775/average-daily-time-watching-tv-us-by-age/) chonk of data indicates the number is actually less for non-retirees, and is decreasing year on year for the younger folks.

Let's just say I averaged 4.5 hours of TV per day. Though I know some days would've been MUCH more. This *very* helpful [overview of the campaign](https://www.encyclopedia.com/marketing/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/fosters-group-limited) indicates it ran from 1994 to 2001. Allegedly it worn awards. The budget was initially $3 million a year and then $10 million a year. It seems I wouldn't have seen it before 1997 on the lower budget.The *conclusion* of the ads is unclear, but it appears reasonable to assume it wrapped up around 2004.

Seven years? Cool.

Seven years times 365 days times 4.5 hours is 11,497.5 hours of television-watching. That's 14-28 ads per hour based [on estimates](https://mocktheagency.com/content/how-many-tv-ads-per-hour/#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20viewers%20watch%20around,ad%20is%2030%20seconds%20long.). This changes based on the length of the ad - some are 5 second bumpers and others are 60 seconds long.

I would've watched HBO and films too. Let's say that was a quarter of my watching (generous - probably less). And also considering time where there would *never* be a Foster's commercial (Saturday morning cartoons). I think 10 qualified ads per hour of TV watched is reasonable.

Which makes us at a cool 114,975 ads. Let's make it 115,000 because we can.

That's..... Not as many as I thought? The upper bound (if I watched more TV and underestimated ad density) is probably around 200,000 and the lower bound I would be shocked if it's under 100,000.
