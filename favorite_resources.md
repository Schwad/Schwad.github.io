I don't live near many rubyists.

Having spent my Ruby/Rails career in remote Montana and then in remote Cornwall (UK), I have been very lucky to craft and create software while enjoying being removed from the city life. I also get to work for a small, flexible company. The trade off? Almost all of my 'Ruby' networking and community has had to come from web-accessible resources.

I recently [spoke at Isle of Ruby](www.isleofruby.org)(which will get its own post soon). This topic came up with some there. Following further discussions I decided to publish my favorite ruby resource for those of you in a similar position.

This list is by no means comprehensive and changes all the time, but it's the sort of thing I wish I had access to from day one. Without further adieu....

## A few of my favorite (ruby) things

* I post generally useful things I come across and 'do not want to forget' (i.e. more than a bookmark) on my page here: https://schwad.github.io/reading-list/

### Podcasts

* [The Bikeshed](http://bikeshed.fm/) (Derek Prior, Sean Griffin and friends - very fun)
* [Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues) (Possibly the longest running one, medium-technical)
* [The Art of Product](http://artofproductpodcast.com/) (Ben Orenstein and Derek Reimer, both big Rubyists, often talk far beyond Ruby and about their careers)
* [The Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails) (Brittany Martin and Kyle Daigle and guests, very very enjoyable)
* [Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm/) (Put out by Thoughtbot - I used to listen to this a lot but it has gotten less and less Ruby based)
* [Ruby5](https://ruby5.codeschool.com/) (This was discontinued in 2016 but is *great* if you want to hear about the past, with 5 minute quick Ruby community updates)

### Newsletters/Blogs:

* [RubyWeekly](https://rubyweekly.com/). This is my bible. If I listen to or read nothing else I *always* read this. I remember the first time they shared a post of mine on here and I felt like a hero!
* [RubyTapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/) by Avdi Grimm - he also runs several newsletters including one called 'Brunch'
* [Schneems](https://www.schneems.com/)! Really nice guy and big contributor, has a blog and newsletter. Very helpful stuff for me from community perspective
* [Aaron Patterson](https://tenderlovemaking.com/) - He doesn't write here much but as one of the big names his writings are great
* [Jesus Castello]( http://www.rubyguides.com/)
* [Andy Croll](https://andycroll.com/ruby/stop-robots-crawlers-triggering-errors-rails/) (who organizes Brighton Ruby Conf)
* [Drifting Ruby](https://www.driftingruby.com/) - they are releasing pro-only videos sometimes now but this is my favorite screencast-er with weekly updates on really interesting stuff and I find it incredibly useful. One of the hosts of Ruby Rogues does this
* Finally [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/). Seriously, it really helped me go from 'I never have done any open source help' to making it a habit. I just get random notifications about old PRs and Issues and I read them. If they need a 'bump' I kindly write 'Hey what's happening here?'. And once in a while I can actually help from the technical perspective.
